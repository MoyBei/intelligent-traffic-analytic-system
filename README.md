# Intelligent Traffic Analytic System

• Individual capstone project for Forward School Applied Deep Learning course to count the number of vehicles passing by a road checkpoint with Deep Learning approaches for traffic analytics usage and urban planning.

• Custom trained YOLO model to predict the vehicle types with bounding boxes, performed object tracking and counting on the detected objects in the video.

• Transfer learning technique was used to speed up model development.

• Tried on various dataset to find out the best model, manually crop the images from Malaysia traffic video and annotate to provide for training.

• Developed with the Java Deeplearning4j and OpenCV framework.
